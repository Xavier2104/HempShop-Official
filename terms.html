            Welcome to HEMPSHOP. By accessing or using our platform, you agree
            to be bound by these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully
            before using our website. These terms may be updated from time to
            time, so please review them periodically.

          <h2>Using HEMPSHOP</h2>
          <p>
            HEMPSHOP is a marketplace that connects verified hemp and
            cannabis merchants with customers. You must be at least 18 years old
            (or the legal age in your jurisdiction) to use the site. By using
            our platform, you agree to provide accurate information and comply
            with all applicable laws and regulations.
          </p>
          <h2>Merchant Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            Merchants must complete our verification process and provide all
            required documentation to sell products on HEMPSHOP. Merchants are
            responsible for ensuring that their products are legal, safe, and
            accurately described. Merchants must adhere to our policies
            regarding product quality, labelling, and advertising.
          </p>
          <h2>Content and Listings</h2>
          <p>
            You are responsible for the content you upload to HEMPSHOP,
            including product descriptions, images, and other materials. We
            reserve the right to remove content or suspend accounts that
            violate our policies or applicable laws. Listings must be
            accurate, non‑misleading, and must not infringe on any third‑party
            rights.
          </p>
          <h2>Compliance and Regulations</h2>
          <p>
            Because hemp and cannabis products are regulated, merchants must
            comply with all relevant regulations in their jurisdictions. We
            provide guidance to help merchants remain compliant but do not
            guarantee or warrant compliance. Customers are responsible for
            understanding the laws in their location before purchasing.
          </p>
          <h2>Termination and Changes</h2>
          <p>
            We may terminate or suspend your access to HEMPSHOP at our
            discretion, especially if you violate these terms or applicable
            laws. We may also modify these terms at any time by posting an
            updated version on our website. Continued use of the platform
            signifies your acceptance of the revised terms.
          </p>
